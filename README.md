## 🚀 Getting Started

You have two main options for getting started: **One-Click Cloud Deployment** or **Local Development**.

### Option 1: One-Click Cloud Deployment (Recommended for Quick Review)

Use the **Deploy with Vercel** button above. You will be prompted to fork the repository and provide the following required environment variables:
* **`MONGODB_URI`**: Your MongoDB connection string (e.g., from MongoDB Atlas).
* **`PAYLOAD_SECRET`**: A long, random string for Payload CMS security.
* **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL`**: The public URL Vercel provides for your new deployment.

### Option 2: Local Development

Follow these steps to get your ecommerce store up and running on your local machine.

#### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Mandala-Software-House/payload-ecommerce-template.git](https://github.com/Mandala-Software-House/payload-ecommerce-template.git)

    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
